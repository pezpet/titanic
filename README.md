# Titanic Kaggle Competition, by [Andres Perez](https://www.andresperez.info/)
The classic Kaggle beginner competition is a classification problem where participants try to predict if a passenger from the Titanic survived, based on their personal information, ticket class, family members aboard, etc.

I have reviewed previous top entries to the competition an my objective is to obtain > 83% testing accuracy with as little code as possible.

Information on the data, including data dictionary is on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
